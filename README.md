# Markdown and Github
Creating a practice repository to learn functionality.
I am still working on my Markdown knowledge so this [link](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet#lists) is helpful.
Some more links for learning how to use Github include [Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and [Explore projects](https://github.com/explore)
